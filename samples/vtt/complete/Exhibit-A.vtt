01:14.400 --> 01:16.000
<v Andy>- Yes?</v>
<v Judith>- Yep.</v>

01:16.200 --> 01:17.200
<v Andy>Action.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.200
<v Andy>Okay, well, uh, through
here we have Camelot…

01:21.200 --> 01:24.300
<v Andy>As you can see, it may
not be Buckingham Palace,

01:24.300 --> 01:27.300
<v Andy>but you’ll certainly find
lots of “Kings” inside.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.000
<v Andy>If you’d like to come through
here, you can see our…

01:30.200 --> 01:32.700
<v Andy>fantastic entrance hall and

01:33.550 --> 01:38.000
<v Andy>in here, yes indeed, is
the Queen of Camelot.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.500
<v Andy>It is our very own sandwich cutter royal.

01:41.655 --> 01:44.730
<v Sheila>- Where did you get that from, darling?</v>
<v Judith>- Dad bought it for me.</v>

01:44.760 --> 01:46.855
<v Andy>Uh, just to replace the other one,
we did talk about it.

01:46.911 --> 01:48.815
<v Sheila>Yes, you, no! You went for a camera.

01:48.845 --> 01:51.053
<v Sheila>- A camera!</v>
<v Andy>- It is a camera.</v>

01:51.093 --> 01:53.230
<v Sheila>Honestly! Give me your wallet.

01:53.293 --> 01:54.725
<v Sheila>Give it over.

01:55.147 --> 01:57.676
<v Sheila>You know what, if you went out for a pint
of milk you’d come back with a cow.

01:57.706 --> 01:58.909
<v Joe>What are you doing?

01:58.943 --> 02:00.502
<v Sheila>- Just in case. Yes.</v>
<v Andy>- No!</v>

02:00.532 --> 02:02.804
<v Sheila>- Until we make sure.</v>
<v Andy>- We are sure.</v>

02:02.858 --> 02:04.924
<v Sheila>I’m sorry, love,

02:04.954 --> 02:06.381
<v Sheila>I don’t think she was that bothered.

02:06.415 --> 02:09.106
<v Judith>- She ran away screaming.</v>
<v Joe>- Where did Wurzel get this from?</v>

02:09.151 --> 02:10.151
<v Judith>Uh, none of your business.

02:10.181 --> 02:12.643
<v Andy>Video camera, to replace the other one.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.213
<v Andy>- So me and your mum have memories to…</v>
<v Judith>- Move your ugly face out of my screen.</v>

02:15.265 --> 02:16.605
<v Andy>- look back on when we’re old and senile.</v>
<v Judith>- You’ll crack it.</v>

02:16.676 --> 02:18.688
<v Joe>Do you fancy jumping on my computer
so I can get an upgrade as well?

02:18.799 --> 02:20.824
<v Andy>Uh, I’ll just remind you that if you
hadn’t been acting the goat,

02:20.856 --> 02:23.253
<v Andy>I’d never have stood on
the camera in the first place.

02:23.283 --> 02:24.808
<v Joe>- Yeah, my fault as usual.</v>
<v Judith>- Just get out of my way.</v>

02:24.839 --> 02:26.789
<v Andy>I thought you were going
to move these brochures?

02:26.918 --> 02:27.918
<v Judith>Mum!

02:27.948 --> 02:29.629
<v Sheila>Judith, don’t be selfish,
let him have a turn.

02:30.570 --> 02:31.570
<v Judith>Get stuffed!

02:34.174 --> 02:36.915
<v Joe>Urgh, look at the pair on that!

02:37.002 --> 02:38.548
<v Andy>- Oi!</v>
<v Sheila>- Hey, hey, hey!</v>

02:38.602 --> 02:39.650
<v Joe>Bom-didi-bom-bom! Bom-didi-bom-bom!

02:39.689 --> 02:41.507
<v Judith>- Dad!</v>
<v Andy>- Hey, what are you doing?!</v>

02:47.848 --> 02:49.098
<v Judith>This is my room.

02:51.962 --> 02:53.905
<v Judith>Oh, these are my photos.

02:54.646 --> 02:57.851
<v Judith>I do most of them at the park,
that’s one of my favourites.

03:00.874 --> 03:03.132
<v Judith>That’s my “throne”,
as dad likes to call it.

03:09.654 --> 03:10.668
<v Judith>A shell.

03:14.892 --> 03:19.562
<v Judith>Hah, Mr. Miller, scrubbing his animals.

03:19.595 --> 03:21.195
<v Judith>The birds shit on them.

03:26.317 --> 03:29.455
<v Judith>That’s Darren, don’t know
why I’ve still got him.

03:33.688 --> 03:34.782
<v Judith>And that’s…

03:37.594 --> 03:38.594
<v Judith>You.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.110
<v Judith>Camera…

03:53.150 --> 03:55.050
<v Judith>Meet Claire.

03:57.875 --> 03:58.875
<v Andy><i>Judith?</i>

04:02.632 --> 04:03.662
<v Andy><i>Come on, Angel!</i>

04:09.588 --> 04:10.588
<v Andy><i>Come on, Angel…</i>

04:16.191 --> 04:17.846
<v Joe>Pull the boa constrictor.

04:20.993 --> 04:22.646
<v Sheila>Makes you look like a model.

04:24.590 --> 04:26.211
<v Sheila>8 hours in make-up.

04:26.758 --> 04:29.667
<v Judith>Yep, and what am I
supposed to be filming?

04:30.105 --> 04:33.523
<v Andy>- Just point it out of that window, there.</v>
<v Judith>- That one there.</v>

04:33.571 --> 04:34.727
<v Judith>To film…

04:34.936 --> 04:36.034
<v Andy>- That.</v>
<v Judith>- That?</v>

04:36.095 --> 04:37.645
<v Joe>007 looks a bit lost!

04:41.060 --> 04:42.107
<v Andy>So…

04:42.198 --> 04:44.432
<v Andy>How do you two feel about living
in a house like this then?

04:44.484 --> 04:46.853
<v Sheila><i>If</i> your dad gets his promotion.

04:47.729 --> 04:48.917
<v Joe>Really?

04:50.099 --> 04:51.488
<v Joe>Yeah, wicked.

04:52.391 --> 04:53.391
<v Andy>Angel?

04:56.052 --> 04:57.967
<v Judith>But, what’s wrong with
where we live now?

05:00.079 --> 05:01.623
<v Andy>What’s wrong with it?

05:01.653 --> 05:02.837
<v Andy>Wayne…

05:04.621 --> 05:05.970
<v Joe>What about that for a view, eh?

05:09.933 --> 05:12.447
<v Andy>We’ll get these swimming lessons
finally sorted for you, aren’t we, eh?

05:12.543 --> 05:14.264
<v Andy>There’s no point in having the
North Sea in your back garden…

05:14.294 --> 05:15.931
<v Andy>if you’re afraid of water, is there?

05:17.243 --> 05:20.666
<v Andy>Our mermaid, eh? In her element.

05:23.710 --> 05:24.710
<v Judith>Dad…

05:25.643 --> 05:26.816
<v Judith>Do we have to move?

05:26.883 --> 05:28.425
<v Andy>I thought you’d be happy, Angel.

05:28.484 --> 05:29.892
<v Judith>Yeah, but…

05:30.209 --> 05:31.209
<v Andy>But?

05:31.750 --> 05:33.759
<v Andy>Come on, your troubles
are my troubles remember?

05:33.901 --> 05:35.919
<v Andy>Double-O dad, troubleshooter.

05:36.791 --> 05:37.891
<v Judith>It’s just…

05:40.239 --> 05:41.239
<v Judith>Nothing.

05:41.269 --> 05:43.632
<v Andy>Honestly, Angel, you’re going to love it.

05:48.279 --> 05:50.414
<v Judith>Don’t drown, any of you.

05:56.295 --> 05:57.899
<v Joe>- Give it here.</v>
<v Judith>- Err, no.</v>

05:57.989 --> 05:58.989
<v Joe>Err, yeah.

05:59.034 --> 06:00.164
<v Judith>Err, no!

06:00.235 --> 06:01.485
<v Judith>Get off me!

06:02.170 --> 06:03.326
<v Judith>Fuck off!

06:03.475 --> 06:04.754
<v Joe>Watch out for the sha–

06:12.910 --> 06:14.838
<v Sheila>This is fantastic, isn’t it?

06:15.091 --> 06:17.462
<v Joe>This isn’t going to be another
Croatian timeshare, is it?

06:17.565 --> 06:19.407
<v Sheila>Oh, like you mean the one
with no roof so we can…

06:19.570 --> 06:21.160
<v Sheila>- See the stars!</v>
<v Joe>- See the stars!</v>

06:21.306 --> 06:23.018
<v Sheila>Oh, I don’t know, darling.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.686
<v Sheila>It would be brilliant, wouldn’t
it, if he got this promotion but,

06:25.733 --> 06:27.800
<v Sheila>you know your dad and his dreams.

06:27.965 --> 06:29.119
<v Andy>What are you two laughing at?

06:29.696 --> 06:31.458
<v Andy>Oh, you’re looking at him, I know.

06:34.770 --> 06:35.868
<v Andy>Alright, where’s this picnic then?

06:36.703 --> 06:37.703
<v Sheila>It’s coming,

06:37.733 --> 06:38.947
<v Sheila>it’s coming, it’s coming!

06:40.549 --> 06:43.016
<v Andy>I just want to get one
more shot of the house.

06:43.665 --> 06:45.761
<v Andy>Anyway, you can’t talk
about wasting tape.

06:45.791 --> 06:48.107
<v Judith>It wasn’t me, alright? He left it on.

06:48.152 --> 06:49.840
<v Joe>Me? She won’t let me touch it.

06:49.946 --> 06:51.321
<v Andy>- Alright, alright.</v>
<v Joe>- It’s easy, Prudith,</v>

06:51.351 --> 06:52.929
<v Joe>- it’s the button on the back.</v>
<v Andy>- Anyway, I’ve rewound it back to…</v>

06:52.959 --> 06:54.004
<v Andy>- the beginning of the picnic.</v>
<v Sheila>- Like you’d know.</v>

06:57.103 --> 06:58.103
<v Judith>Morning.

07:02.386 --> 07:04.099
<v Judith>We went to see a new house yesterday.

07:05.963 --> 07:07.405
<v Judith>We’re thinking of moving.

07:09.402 --> 07:10.606
<v Judith>I can’t believe it.

07:10.715 --> 07:12.492
<v Judith>As soon as you move in, they’re…

07:12.695 --> 07:13.695
<v Ray>- Hey, Jude.</v>
<v Judith>- Oh, hey, Ray.</v>

07:13.750 --> 07:14.910
<v Ray>What are you filming?

07:15.024 --> 07:16.794
<v Judith>Oh, I thought I saw a squirrel.

07:16.899 --> 07:18.051
<v Ray>Really? Huh.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.731
<v Ray>Anyway, make sure you get my best side.

07:22.678 --> 07:24.847
<v Judith>That’s Ray, dad’s mate from work.

07:24.928 --> 07:27.766
<v Sheila>Are you just about done, guys?
Because you need to give me a lift to work.

07:27.827 --> 07:29.996
<v Andy>Sorry, love, I completely
lost track of the time.

07:30.087 --> 07:33.887
<v Ray>- Had enough of bed pans, eh?</v>
<v Sheila>- Oh, you know, another day another incontinence bag.</v>

07:34.887 --> 07:36.399
<v Ray>That’s an image I’ll take with me.

07:38.463 --> 07:40.775
<v Sheila>Right, you need to be over here, okay,
if you stand next to the table for us.

07:40.859 --> 07:42.521
<v Judith>Look, Joe, you can film it.

07:42.551 --> 07:44.484
<v Sheila>- Oh, why?</v>
<v Judith>- Because I don’t feel like it.</v>

07:44.599 --> 07:46.729
<v Joe>- She’s a waste of tape.</v>
<v Sheila>- Oh, what’s the matter with you?</v>

07:46.759 --> 07:48.836
<v Joe>- Smile, Moodith.</v>
<v Sheila>- Come on, leave her alone.</v>

07:49.296 --> 07:51.787
<v Sheila>Um, stand next to the table.

08:02.150 --> 08:03.265
<v Joe>He’s coming.

08:03.438 --> 08:04.438
<v Andy>Hello?

08:05.961 --> 08:06.961
<v Sheila>Surprise!

08:08.059 --> 08:09.863
<v Andy>Wow, look at that!

08:10.897 --> 08:11.897
<v Sheila>Well?

08:12.093 --> 08:14.029
<v Andy>Ah well, you know…

08:14.475 --> 08:17.060
<v Sheila>Oh, fuck. Not again.

08:17.090 --> 08:18.884
<v Andy>Oh, you’re talking about the promotion?

08:18.945 --> 08:21.428
<v Andy>Oh well, uh, I got that.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.511
<v Sheila>- Really?</v>
<v Andy>- Promised, didn’t I?</v>

08:24.621 --> 08:25.685
<v Sheila>Oh, you…

08:25.880 --> 08:26.880
<v Sheila>Yes!

08:29.571 --> 08:31.293
<v Sheila>Oh, you little smasher!

08:32.251 --> 08:33.684
<v Judith>Piss off!

08:34.716 --> 08:37.194
<v Sheila>Fantastic! That’s so good.

08:37.330 --> 08:39.172
<v Judith>So we’re… we’re really moving, then?

08:39.244 --> 08:41.774
<v Sheila>Too right we are, we’re going to put
that offer in first thing in the morning.

08:41.804 --> 08:43.388
<v Sheila>Oh, wow!

08:44.327 --> 08:46.476
<v Sheila>Oh, try not to look too
happy about it, Judith.

08:46.547 --> 08:48.898
<v Judith>I am happy, alright? I’m happy.

08:49.994 --> 08:51.194
<v Judith>Well done, dad.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.557
<v Sheila>Catch it, catch it, catch it.

08:54.963 --> 08:56.489
<v Sheila>Oh, steady on, Joe.

08:58.590 --> 08:59.907
<v Sheila>Some for you…

09:01.104 --> 09:02.519
<v Sheila>Some for you…

09:02.560 --> 09:06.032
<v Sheila>Oh, this is just so brilliant.

09:06.483 --> 09:08.533
<v Sheila>I think we should have a toast.

09:09.430 --> 09:10.512
<v Sheila>No more bed pans.

09:10.542 --> 09:12.073
<v Joe>To parties on the beach!

09:12.675 --> 09:13.678
<v Sheila>And to the new…

09:13.708 --> 09:14.731
<v Sheila>- Area manager.</v>
<v Joe>- Area manager.</v>

09:14.761 --> 09:15.840
<v Andy>To infinity…

09:15.899 --> 09:18.834
<v Andy>- And beyond!</v>
<v Sheila>- And beyond!</v>

09:19.153 --> 09:21.324
<v Andy>Can’t you give me a better clue?

09:21.403 --> 09:23.055
<v Andy>What am I looking for?

09:23.126 --> 09:24.342
<v Sheila>It’s not a video, is it?

09:24.379 --> 09:25.842
<v Andy>- Well I don’t know, might be!</v>
<v Sheila>- Well, it’s not.</v>

09:25.872 --> 09:28.787
<v Andy>She’s had that camera, she could have
been videoing all my best comedy moments.

09:28.817 --> 09:31.336
<v Sheila>You’re not warm enough here. You’re warm,
but you’re not hot. You need to get hotter.

09:31.366 --> 09:33.131
<v Andy>- Warm, but not hot…</v>
<v Sheila>- Little bit hotter.</v>

09:36.253 --> 09:39.509
<v Sheila>There’s a little interloper,
isn’t there? In the vicinity.

09:39.539 --> 09:40.539
<v Sheila>Moving in…

09:42.932 --> 09:44.688
<v Andy>Who has been…

09:47.479 --> 09:50.468
<v Andy>sneaking things into
my comedy collection?

09:53.199 --> 09:54.199
<v Andy>Oh, well…

09:57.827 --> 10:00.654
<v Andy>Yeah, a pair of second-hand
glasses for your blind old dad.

10:00.836 --> 10:03.435
<v Joe>- We didn’t have that much money.</v>
<v Sheila>- They’re not just any old glasses.</v>

10:04.057 --> 10:05.149
<v Andy>I know whose they are, love.

10:07.897 --> 10:09.167
<v Andy>Where did you find them?

10:09.321 --> 10:10.388
<v Joe>On the Internet.

10:10.747 --> 10:11.847
<v Sheila>Yeah, look…

10:12.571 --> 10:14.485
<v Sheila>Look at the certificate.

10:16.041 --> 10:17.387
<v Andy>Eric Morecambe.

10:18.554 --> 10:19.754
<v Andy>Comedy greats.

10:22.035 --> 10:25.357
<i.action>[mimicking]</i> <v Andy>Little Ern, little Ern…
What do you think of the show so far?

10:25.430 --> 10:26.970
<v Andy>- Rubbish!</v>
<v Sheila>- Rubbish!</v>

10:28.048 --> 10:29.645
<v Judith>That was good, dad.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.988
<v Andy>It’s all, uh…

10:37.389 --> 10:38.735
<v Andy>It’s all perfect.

10:42.398 --> 10:43.398
<v Andy>Sorry…

10:48.065 --> 10:49.065
<v Sheila>Darling…

10:51.775 --> 10:53.253
<v Sheila>You soft sausage.

10:53.283 --> 10:54.548
<v Andy>I’m sorry.

10:59.108 --> 11:00.517
<v Sheila>Get on with it.

11:00.547 --> 11:04.006
<v Sheila>I’ve put a little list on the pinboard, alright?
Of things you’ll be able to do today.

11:04.036 --> 11:06.993
<v Sheila>Do something about the
hole in the garden,

11:07.349 --> 11:10.067
<v Sheila>and you are going to ring
the mortgage people,

11:10.455 --> 11:13.509
<v Sheila>and I am going to ring the
schools when I get back from work.

11:13.539 --> 11:15.730
<v Sheila>And then we should be…

11:16.000 --> 11:17.092
<v Judith>Here’s dad, doing his trick,

11:17.175 --> 11:18.649
<v Judith>- for the millionth time.</v>
<v Andy>- Mortgage?</v>

11:18.679 --> 11:20.184
<v Sheila>You’re listening to me, aren’t you?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.835
<v Andy>Yes, my sweetheart, every word.

11:23.313 --> 11:26.572
<v Andy>No I was, you said
“do the pond”, and… uh, your list.

11:26.784 --> 11:28.559
<v Sheila>You see, you don’t pay
any attention, do you?

11:28.611 --> 11:31.414
<v Andy>- What?</v>
<v Sheila>- Pond? It’s been like that for a year, Andy!</v>

11:31.444 --> 11:34.470
<v Andy>It’s not been a year at all,
it’s been 9 months if that.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.785
<v Andy>- We’ve had a lot of rain.</v>
<v Judith>- Pond.</v>

11:35.830 --> 11:38.014
<v Andy>You can’t disturb the topsoil when
it’s raining, everybody knows that.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.792
<v Sheila>Oh I remember, the Great Yorkshire
Monsoon kept everybody inside for months.

11:43.227 --> 11:44.311
<v Andy>Never mind,

11:44.348 --> 11:45.864
<v Andy>it’ll be gone tomorrow - Alakazam!

11:46.856 --> 11:49.253
<v Sheila>Good. Now, stop faffing about please…

11:49.283 --> 11:51.449
<v Andy>- Hey!</v>
<v Sheila>- and let’s get inside and get on.</v>

11:51.507 --> 11:54.323
<v Andy>- Tommy Cooper doesn’t have these problems.</v>
<v Sheila>- And you, put your eyes back in.</v>

11:54.851 --> 11:56.383
<v Sheila>The birds will have them.

11:58.484 --> 11:59.960
<v Sheila>Stop ogling the bouncing neighbour.

12:00.014 --> 12:01.014
<v Joe>I’m not.

12:01.214 --> 12:04.844
<v Sheila>Honestly, love, girls prefer it
if you’re not quite so obvious.

12:04.874 --> 12:06.489
<v Sheila>- Don’t we, Judith?</v>
<v Judith>- It’s gross.</v>

12:07.657 --> 12:09.007
<v Joe>Nice spot, Judith.

12:20.178 --> 12:21.178
<v Claire>Hello?

12:23.197 --> 12:24.197
<v Claire>Hello?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.054
<v Joe>- Hey, you alright?</v>
<v Claire>- You alright?</v>

12:30.084 --> 12:31.875
<v Joe>You know, if you wanted to come
round you could have just asked.

12:31.964 --> 12:33.499
<v Claire>I’m just getting my ball.

12:34.744 --> 12:36.084
<v Joe>- Getting good.</v>
<v Claire>- Thanks.</v>

12:36.114 --> 12:38.865
<v Joe>I’ll get you that CD you
wanted: DJ Joe’s <i>Ibiza Mix</i>.

12:38.941 --> 12:41.232
<v Claire>It’s fine honestly,
I’ve got to go anyway.

12:41.262 --> 12:43.560
<v Joe>I’ve got loads so you can have it
any time you want, know what I mean?

12:43.616 --> 12:45.330
<v Claire>I’ll get it later, I’ve got to go.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.360
<v Joe>Well.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.204
<v Joe>Give us a call, text me.

12:48.317 --> 12:49.317
<v Joe>What are you doing?

12:49.347 --> 12:50.485
<v Judith>Just a joke.

12:51.559 --> 12:53.243
<v Joe>Her sense of humour is a cracker.

12:53.288 --> 12:55.706
<v Joe>She’s agoraphobic, we’re
saving up for a rabbit hutch.

12:56.113 --> 12:57.868
<v Claire>- Really gotta go.</v>
<v Joe>- Alright then.</v>

12:57.923 --> 12:59.108
<v Claire>- See ya.</v>
<v Joe>- See ya.</v>

13:01.229 --> 13:03.256
<v Joe>Try better next time, Judith,
someone might laugh.

13:04.588 --> 13:06.083
<v Joe>Fuck off, geek.

13:15.661 --> 13:16.661
<v Judith>Hi.

13:21.779 --> 13:22.779
<v Judith>Hey.

13:32.429 --> 13:33.673
<v Judith>Oh, hi!

13:37.060 --> 13:38.060
<v Judith>Hiya!

13:43.101 --> 13:44.101
<v Judith>Oh, hi!

13:47.292 --> 13:49.392
<v Judith>Let’s see how stupid this looks.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.430
<v Sheila>Well, don’t just dive in!

13:55.105 --> 13:56.107
<v Andy>Is that tea or coffee?

13:58.063 --> 14:00.360
<v Judith>I spy with my little eye…

14:00.756 --> 14:02.986
<v Judith>Joe smoking in the garden.

14:03.556 --> 14:05.487
<v Judith>Dad would kill him if he knew.

14:06.202 --> 14:08.492
<v Judith>Hey, maybe I can blackmail him.

14:08.881 --> 14:11.197
<v Judith>That’ll teach him to
embarrass me in front of you.

14:12.299 --> 14:14.342
<v Judith>Welcome to night vision, Joe.

14:17.903 --> 14:18.903
<v Judith>Dad?

14:24.707 --> 14:27.249
<v Andy>Go, go, go. Right, you filming?
Are you filming?

14:27.314 --> 14:28.790
<v Judith>- Yeah, yeah I am.</v>
<v Andy>- Right, okay.</v>

14:28.820 --> 14:30.059
<v Judith>But you know she’s never
gonna go for this.

14:30.104 --> 14:31.635
<v Andy>No she will, believe me,
just believe me.

14:32.070 --> 14:33.075
<v Andy>Right.

14:33.421 --> 14:36.040
<v Andy>Okay, so, here we are at the Kings’,

14:36.070 --> 14:39.320
<v Andy>and we’ve got a bit of a
surprise for Miss Sheila King.

14:39.358 --> 14:42.464
<v Andy>Because what we know that you
know that she doesn’t know, is…

14:43.061 --> 14:46.868
<v Andy>we’ve got one hell of a surprise
for her this afternoon. So follow me!

14:48.940 --> 14:51.604
<v Sheila>Excuse me, love, what’s going on?

14:51.718 --> 14:53.443
<v Stu>Special delivery, Missus.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.647
<v Sheila>What sort of delivery?

14:54.747 --> 14:56.690
<v Stu>- <i>Special</i> delivery.</v>
<v Judith>- Dead convincing.</v>

14:56.720 --> 14:58.706
<v Sheila>No, I’m sorry, love, I think you
must have come to the wrong house.

14:58.804 --> 15:00.957
<v Stu>- No, we’ve err—</v>
<v Andy>- Mrs. Sheila King, yes,</v>

15:00.987 --> 15:03.771
<v Andy>your husband has arranged a
surprise for you this afternoon!

15:03.801 --> 15:05.083
<v Andy>Thank you very much, Stu!

15:05.125 --> 15:07.019
<v Sheila>It’s you, isn’t it?
The man off the telly!

15:07.092 --> 15:09.628
<v Andy>- Well…</v>
<v Sheila>- Oh gosh, am I on the telly now?</v>

15:09.658 --> 15:13.625
<v Andy>- There we go; look and smile.</v>
<v Sheila>- My husband’s going to be so upset.</v>

15:13.717 --> 15:16.817
<v Andy>Well, I’ve got a surprise
for you because in fact,

15:17.148 --> 15:18.368
<v Andy>I am your husband!

15:19.354 --> 15:20.504
<v Sheila>What a shock!

15:21.390 --> 15:23.336
<v Andy>Right, come this way.
No, straight through.

15:23.421 --> 15:26.294
<v Sheila>- What’s that noise in our garden?</v>
<v Andy>- You’ll find out soon enough, come on.</v>

15:26.580 --> 15:27.838
<v Andy>Through we go.

15:27.903 --> 15:30.640
<v Andy>Excuse me, gentlemen, coming through,
coming through, this way.

15:30.711 --> 15:31.755
<v Sheila>- Oh, what’s going on?</v>
<v Andy>- Quickly, Judith, because I want…</v>

15:31.807 --> 15:32.937
<v Andy>- you to get your mum’s face as she…</v>
<v Judith>- Okay, yeah!</v>

15:32.980 --> 15:34.813
<v Sheila>- What’s going on?</v>
<v Andy>- Right, into the back.</v>

15:35.114 --> 15:36.602
<v Andy>Yes. Judith, come on.

15:36.677 --> 15:37.856
<v Judith>- I am!</v>
<v Andy>- Right.</v>

15:37.931 --> 15:39.273
<v Sheila>- Oh my God!</v>
<v Judith>- Dad!</v>

15:39.303 --> 15:40.830
<v Sheila>- Oh my God!</v>
<v Andy>- Here we go!</v>

15:40.877 --> 15:42.505
<v Sheila>What are you doing?

15:42.958 --> 15:45.716
<v Sheila>You’re supposed to be filling it in!

15:46.274 --> 15:48.923
<v Sheila>- What are you doing?!</v>
<v Andy>- Sweetheart, I…</v>

15:49.089 --> 15:52.427
<v Sheila>Get out of there! Get out of
there now, you stupid idiot.

15:52.457 --> 15:55.866
<v Sheila>- Get off!</v>
<v Andy>- Sweetheart, I had a complete brainwave.</v>

15:55.909 --> 15:58.214
<v Sheila>I don’t know what you think you’re doing,
but I don’t want any of this stuff in here.

15:58.244 --> 15:59.449
<v Sheila>- Just take it out.</v>
<v Andy>- Judith, come over here.</v>

15:59.482 --> 16:00.811
<v Andy>- A complete brainwave this morning.</v>
<v Sheila>- Take it out!</v>

16:00.843 --> 16:02.833
<v Andy>- I went to get the topsoil…</v>
<v Sheila>- Look at my garden!</v>

16:02.863 --> 16:04.477
<v Andy>to fill in the pond.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.153
<v Andy>- And while I was there I had a genius idea:</v>
<v Sheila>- Look at this!</v>

16:07.457 --> 16:10.842
<v Andy>Instead of filling it in,
let’s make it bigger.

16:10.984 --> 16:14.719
<v Andy>It’ll add 20 grand on the value
of the house because we will have…

16:14.749 --> 16:16.801
<v Andy>A pool!

16:17.979 --> 16:22.290
<v Sheila>Have you completely lost it?
We are <i>selling</i> the house!

16:22.357 --> 16:25.491
<v Andy>Exactly, and this way we
can whack the price up!

16:25.602 --> 16:28.672
<v Judith>- Dad, I told you this would happen.</v>
<v Andy>- It’ll only take us a fortnight.</v>

16:29.082 --> 16:30.516
<v Sheila>I’ve got buyers coming.

16:30.769 --> 16:31.782
<v Sheila>What are we going to do?

16:31.854 --> 16:34.268
<v Sheila>What are we going to say
when they see all this lot?

16:34.431 --> 16:36.502
<v Andy>- Well it’s fine, it’s fine.</v>
<v Judith>- Dad!</v>

16:36.578 --> 16:37.914
<v Andy>They’ll be able to use
their imagination.

16:37.957 --> 16:39.917
<v Sheila>- Will you get out of there!?</v>
<v Andy>- And we’ll be able to show them…</v>

16:39.947 --> 16:41.566
<v Andy>the brochure, can’t we?

16:43.983 --> 16:45.321
<v Andy>- Look. Just—</v>
<v Judith>- Dad,</v>

16:45.383 --> 16:47.044
<v Judith>I told you this would happen, can I…

16:47.210 --> 16:50.700
<v Sheila>I can’t believe you’ve done all
this and you didn’t even ask me!

16:51.967 --> 16:54.204
<v Sheila>Your daughter’s terrified of water!

16:54.296 --> 16:57.180
<v Andy>- She’s fine with it, aren’t you, Angel?</v>
<v Judith>- I’m not bothered.</v>

16:57.226 --> 17:00.454
<v Andy>Anyway, that’s not the point.
The point is that we’ll get to move.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.875
<v Sheila>- Can you stop bringing stuff in!?</v>
<v Andy>- Come over here.</v>

17:01.973 --> 17:03.680
<v Andy>Get your mum’s face.

17:03.959 --> 17:07.009
<v Andy>We’ll get to move quicker.
That’s the whole point.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.326
<v Andy>You know…

17:08.900 --> 17:11.635
<v Andy>Alright then, okay, it’s old
Eden stock, we can send it back…

17:11.672 --> 17:12.985
<v Sheila>- Yes!</v>
<v Andy>- if that’s what you want.</v>

17:13.059 --> 17:16.668
<v Sheila>- Yes, do that, just get it all taken back.</v>
<v Andy>- I just wish you’d be practical.</v>

17:33.101 --> 17:35.897
<v Sheila>- That’s it, there.</v>
<v Andy>- Angel, sorry, Joe!</v>

17:37.207 --> 17:38.874
<v Andy>Just put it on the ground.

on the blink, and then the…

18:28.950 --> 18:30.477

your commissions, have you? ‘Cause…

18:30.507 --> 18:32.640

<v Andy>- Yeah, he’s Mr. Successful now.</v>

a drink, you’ll have a G&amp;T, won’t you?

18:36.160 --> 18:37.641
<v Andy>Yeah, we can have one in
the kitchen. Come through.

<v Ray>So, err, what’s going on here?

18:45.481 --> 18:46.830
<v Ray>Are you starting a mine or something?

18:46.860 --> 18:48.986
<v Andy>Just a bit of DIY, you know,
home improvements.

18:49.016 --> 18:51.430
<v Mo>As in a swimming pool,
can you believe it?

18:51.727 --> 18:53.010

19:00.125 --> 19:01.697
<v Sheila>- Yes.</v>
<v Ray>- Dream come true for you.</v>

19:01.727 --> 19:05.120

<v Judith>Can I get you a drink, Claire?

19:09.670 --> 19:12.394

<v Mr. Miller>- Barbecue?</v>

Two weeks or so, perhaps.

<v Claire>Oh come on, it’ll be a couple
of days after my birthday.

19:21.859 --> 19:26.356

you about the fact that we’re moving.

19:30.558 --> 19:33.267
<v Andy>Yeah, yeah, happened
very suddenly, but…

19:33.297 --> 19:36.598
<v Andy>we’re off to the coast
hopefully, uh I think.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.194

20:07.409 --> 20:08.612
<v Andy>Try now, turn the ignition on.

20:08.642 --> 20:11.136
<v Judith>Looks like dad’s broken
another piece of equipment.

20:12.267 --> 20:14.617
<v Judith>He’s trying to pretend he can fix it.

20:15.508 --> 20:17.408
<v Judith>This may take some time.

20:19.023 --> 20:20.625
<v Andy>Alright, that’s enough, that’s enough.

20:20.655 --> 20:22.677
<v Judith>- That’s your mum.</v>
<v Andy>- Try it again.</v>

20:22.763 --> 20:24.350
<v Judith>- Hanging out your washing.</v>
<v Andy>- As far as it’ll go.</v>

20:26.014 --> 20:27.390
<v Judith>Your basketball kit.

20:27.805 --> 20:29.169
<v Andy>Not enough!

20:34.350 --> 20:36.469
<v Andy>- Fuck! Bloody stupid.</v>
<v Joe>- Knackered.</v>

20:37.444 --> 20:39.089
<v Andy>Stupid bloody thing.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.834
<v Judith>Hiya.

21:03.302 --> 21:04.654
<v Claire>Where is he?

21:19.789 --> 21:21.666
<v Claire>- Are you a little bit wet?</v>
<v Joe>- Just a bit.</v>

21:37.159 --> 21:38.377
<v Judith>Hi, Claire.

21:38.968 --> 21:40.101
<v Judith>Claire?

21:52.639 --> 21:54.313
<v Andy>Of course I left a message.

21:54.761 --> 21:56.369
<v Wayne>- You left a message?</v>
<v Andy>- Confirming the offer.</v>

21:56.399 --> 21:57.806
<v Wayne>- With our secretary?</v>
<v Andy>- Yeah.</v>

21:57.836 --> 22:00.937
<v Andy>No, no… on your, on your answerphone.

22:00.967 --> 22:03.699
<v Sheila>- You left a message on their answerphone?</v>
<v Andy>- Yeah, that’s what answerphones are for!</v>

22:03.729 --> 22:06.404
<v Andy>Well I didn’t know nobody
was going to check it, did I?

22:06.434 --> 22:08.420
<v Wayne>I can assure you, Mr. King,
I haven’t had any message.

22:08.450 --> 22:11.118
<v Andy>Look, it’s fine, it’s not the end of
the world, we’ll just start again.

22:11.148 --> 22:14.477
<v Andy>- Alright, we’d like to confirm our offer.</v>
<v Wayne>- It’s not as simple as that.</v>

22:14.507 --> 22:16.256
<v Joe>- Dad’s fucked up again.</v>
<v Judith>- Shut up.</v>

22:16.286 --> 22:17.852
<v Wayne>We’ve had another offer
from another family.

22:17.882 --> 22:19.078
<v Joe>- Are you filming?</v>
<v Wayne>- A higher offer than yours.</v>

22:19.679 --> 22:21.209
<v Judith>- No.</v>
<v Andy>- How much higher?</v>

22:21.239 --> 22:22.482
<v Wayne>£7,000.

22:26.378 --> 22:29.046
<v Andy>Right, and you expect
us to top that, do you?

22:29.076 --> 22:30.983
<v Wayne>- Well that is up to you, Mr. King.</v>
<v Andy>- No, I’m sorry, it’s not.</v>

22:31.013 --> 22:33.675
<v Andy>This is a mistake that was made
in your office.

22:33.705 --> 22:35.668
<v Wayne>- Mr. King…</v>
<v Andy>- No, I’m sorry,</v>

22:35.698 --> 22:37.787
<v Andy>it’s out of order and I
want to talk to your boss.

22:37.817 --> 22:40.248
<v Wayne>I <i>am</i> the co-owner of
the business, Mr. King.

22:40.278 --> 22:42.640
<v Wayne>- Now I’d be happy to show you…</v>
<v Andy>- Okay, okay. Enough!</v>

22:55.998 --> 22:57.947
<v Andy>Listen, love, erm…

23:01.383 --> 23:02.735
<v Judith>What is it, dad?

23:03.235 --> 23:04.417
<v Sheila>I’m listening.

23:09.698 --> 23:11.927
<v Andy>Right, well, we’ll, we’ll…

23:13.511 --> 23:15.942
<v Andy>You’ve got us over a barrel, we’ll
better their offer, we’ll put in 10 grand.

23:15.972 --> 23:18.038
<v Andy>3 grand above theirs. Will that do it?

23:18.595 --> 23:21.120
<v Wayne>- Yeah, that…</v>
<v Andy>- Brilliant, okay, problem solved.</v>

23:24.492 --> 23:27.001
<v Joe>Zombie, ninja fight. Round 5, fight!

23:28.212 --> 23:29.321
<v Joe>Choose weapon.

23:32.598 --> 23:35.012
<v Judith>What the hell are you
doing with my camera?

23:35.461 --> 23:36.527
<v Judith>Give it back!

23:37.563 --> 23:38.696
<v Judith>Give it back!

23:39.841 --> 23:42.689
<v Joe>- Aim for head! Aim for head!</v>
<v Judith>- Oh grow up, you freak!</v>

23:43.782 --> 23:45.215
<v Joe>Scanning for new weapon.

23:47.309 --> 23:48.418
<i.action>[in Scottish accent]</i>
<v Joe>Trusty trowel!</v>

23:49.868 --> 23:51.768
<i.action>[in Scottish accent]</i>
<v Joe>The garden spoon of doom.</v>

23:53.769 --> 23:55.661
<v Joe>Hello, Mr. Miller, we meet again.

23:56.605 --> 23:58.529
<v Joe>Get Mr. Miller off my island.

24:02.678 --> 24:05.023
<v Joe>Arguing in the ranks,
this is not a good sign.

24:05.053 --> 24:07.162
<v Joe>We will have to finish mission alone.

24:15.358 --> 24:17.417
<v Andy>And he’s forgotten the Andytron!

24:18.830 --> 24:20.402
<v Joe>Enemy attacking!

24:24.433 --> 24:28.713
<v Joe>- Blobbatron destroyed!</v>
<v Judith>- Loser!</v>

24:31.624 --> 24:33.697
<v Andy>That would have been great
for <i>You’ve Been Framed!</i>

24:33.727 --> 24:35.680
<v Joe>Yeah, that’s really funny.

24:36.245 --> 24:38.245
<v Andy>And, go!

24:38.425 --> 24:42.258
<v Andy>So here we are in the
garden of the Superkings!

24:42.288 --> 24:44.186
<v Andy>And what’s happening today, Angel?

24:44.216 --> 24:47.720
<v Judith>We’re digging a pool. I’m doing the
shovelling, and Joe’s wheeling the barrow.

24:50.454 --> 24:52.204
<v Andy>You must be joking!

24:52.234 --> 24:54.978
<v Joe>- No, no, one more.</v>
<v Andy>- Exactly where you were before.</v>

24:55.008 --> 24:58.190
<v Andy>Okay, and, okay off you go.

24:58.528 --> 25:01.807
<v Andy>It’s erm… a happy day in the
Superkings’ garden, and…

25:01.837 --> 25:04.190
<v Andy>Tell me, Angel, what’s happening today?

25:04.293 --> 25:07.985
<v Judith>We’re digging a pool,
I’m shovelling, and Joe’s wheeling.

25:09.901 --> 25:11.001
<v Andy>No!

25:11.031 --> 25:15.409
<v Andy>Look, the telly people will never give us
250 quid unless you make it more real.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.663
<v Judith>You go when I say “barrow”.

25:17.693 --> 25:20.270
<v Andy>Don’t look back. Look…

25:20.300 --> 25:23.583
<v Andy>- Okay, okay, this time…</v>
<v Joe>- I think that last one was alright.</v>

25:24.110 --> 25:26.590
<v Andy>Alright, let’s ask our
audience. Was it alright?

25:26.620 --> 25:28.991
<v Judith>I think we should do it again
because it was rubbish.

25:29.021 --> 25:31.030
<v Andy>I think we should do it again too.

25:31.264 --> 25:33.028
<v Andy>Concentrate please.

25:33.058 --> 25:35.496
<v Andy>Here we are in the
garden of the Superkings,

25:35.526 --> 25:37.889
<v Andy>and what’s happening today, love?

25:38.516 --> 25:41.878
<v Judith>Digging a pool. I’m shovelling
and Joe’s wheeling.

25:42.485 --> 25:44.579
<v Andy>Right, and…

25:46.253 --> 25:47.253
<v Andy>Come on…

25:49.353 --> 25:52.940
<v Andy>Look surprised, try and get the,
do that thing you did with your arms.

25:53.083 --> 25:55.219
<v Joe>- It hurts.</v>
<v Andy>- Look, I’ll show you, here.</v>

25:58.701 --> 26:00.051
<v Joe>Told you it hurt.

26:01.739 --> 26:03.830
<v Andy>- It didn’t hurt.</v>
<v Joe>- It hurt.</v>

26:04.725 --> 26:07.486
<v Andy>It didn’t hurt, I was just
pretending, you Bernard.

26:11.394 --> 26:13.405
<v Andy>- Were you filming that?</v>
<v Judith>- No.</v>

26:13.805 --> 26:17.883
<v Andy>Okay, lots of fun, and here we are,
in the Superkings’ garden…

26:18.599 --> 26:21.348
<v Andy>and what is happening today?

26:21.378 --> 26:24.779
<v Judith>We’re digging a pool,
I’m shovelling, Joe’s wheeling.

26:25.271 --> 26:27.845
<v Andy>Okay, and…

26:27.875 --> 26:29.156
<v Andy>No!

26:29.694 --> 26:32.163
<v Andy>Come on! That’s not what you did before.

26:32.506 --> 26:33.606
<v Andy>Now get out!

26:34.580 --> 26:36.253
<v Andy>Now you’re starting to take the piss!

26:36.283 --> 26:38.179
<v Andy>Back. One last time.

26:39.379 --> 26:40.972
<v Andy>You ready?

26:41.002 --> 26:42.283
<v Andy>I’m talking to you, are you ready?

26:42.313 --> 26:43.922
<v Joe>- Yes!</v>
<v Andy>- Right, go.</v>

26:45.334 --> 26:48.737
<v Andy>So, what’s happening today, Angel,
in the garden of the Superkings?

26:48.767 --> 26:52.536
<v Judith>Digging pool, shovelling soil in
there and Joe’s wheeling the barrow.

26:52.566 --> 26:55.071
<v Andy>Digging the pool? Okay, no…

26:55.764 --> 26:57.863
<v Andy>Now you are just <i>not</i> trying!

26:58.163 --> 27:00.651
<v Joe>- It hurts!</v>
<v Andy>- It doesn’t hurt! Get out!</v>

27:01.081 --> 27:02.555
<v Judith>Dad, that was really good.

27:02.585 --> 27:04.260
<v Andy>No it wasn’t. Right.

27:06.671 --> 27:07.673
<v Andy>Again.

27:08.727 --> 27:11.314
<v Andy>So here we are in the
garden of the Superkings.

27:12.365 --> 27:14.541
<v Andy>And what’s going on today, Angel?

27:14.949 --> 27:18.276
<v Judith>We’re digging a pool. I’m shovelling
and Joe’s doing the barrow.

27:18.737 --> 27:19.771
<v Andy>Okay.

27:20.267 --> 27:23.835
<v Andy>You are just not trying!
Will you get out of there now!?

27:23.865 --> 27:24.865
<v Joe>No, that’s it.

27:25.486 --> 27:26.486
<v Andy>- Get out!</v>
<v Judith>- Dad, that was fine.</v>

27:26.516 --> 27:27.547
<v Joe>Fuck off!

27:28.001 --> 27:29.351
<v Andy>What did you say?

27:29.702 --> 27:31.052
<v Andy>What did you say?

27:31.989 --> 27:35.699
<v Andy>Why is it that you can’t put
even the remotest bit…

27:35.729 --> 27:37.376
<v Andy>of fucking effort into this family?!

27:37.406 --> 27:41.020
<v Joe>Because your fucking ideas
are stupid, that’s why!

27:41.130 --> 27:43.323
<v Joe>Let’s get a timeshare
with no fucking roof!

27:43.593 --> 27:47.406
<v Joe>Let’s get mum a car that’s a
fucking cut-and-shut! Fucking sick!

27:47.436 --> 27:49.236
<v Andy>And I’ll tell you another
fucking stupid idea,

27:49.554 --> 27:52.152
<v Andy>having a son that’s such a
fucking disappointment!

27:52.182 --> 27:53.713
<v Joe>Stupid fucking loser!

27:53.743 --> 27:55.108
<v Andy>Selfish little shit!

27:55.138 --> 27:56.657
<v Judith>Please! Dad!

28:01.576 --> 28:04.373
<v Judith>Dad? What’s wrong?

28:05.803 --> 28:07.315
<v Andy>Nothing, Angel,

28:08.238 --> 28:09.916
<v Andy>just a bit of a row that’s all.

28:09.946 --> 28:12.323
<v Judith>Look please, dad,
is it work or something?

28:12.353 --> 28:14.941
<v Andy>No, Angel, honestly
everything’s fine I promise.

28:16.094 --> 28:20.555
<v Judith>Look it’s not fine, just look at yourself!
It’s not right, it’s not normal!

28:20.585 --> 28:23.274
<v Andy>Angel, please, please.

28:23.304 --> 28:26.811
<v Judith>Just stop treating me
like a bloody kid, alright!?

28:31.306 --> 28:32.856
<v Judith>Where are you hiding?

28:57.370 --> 28:58.370
<v Judith>Dad?

29:42.683 --> 29:43.883
<v Judith>What the hell?

29:57.356 --> 30:01.035
<v Judith>I just don’t understand
what’s going on anymore, dad.

30:04.975 --> 30:06.425
<v Judith>I’m gonna find out.

30:10.324 --> 30:13.066
<v Judith>I’m gonna show you what
you’re being like.

30:14.178 --> 30:16.548
<v Andy>Slow down, Joe, Joe, Joe,
I want to get the…

30:16.578 --> 30:19.369
<v Judith>- Dad, that’s mine.</v>
<v Andy>- Don’t be so camera shy, Angel.</v>

30:19.399 --> 30:21.664
<v Judith>- No, look, I’ll do the filming.</v>
<v Andy>- No, no, no, no, shh.</v>

30:21.694 --> 30:23.099
<v Judith>- Dad!</v>
<v Andy>- You’ll wake your mum up.</v>

30:23.129 --> 30:24.629
<v Andy>Right, are we ready?

30:25.486 --> 30:27.363
<v Andy>Smile, kids.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.836
<v Andy>A nice big smile.

30:33.619 --> 30:36.802
<v Andy>- Happy birthday!</v>
<v Judith>- Happy birthday, mum.</v>

30:37.877 --> 30:40.164
<v Sheila>Got tangled up in the duvet.

30:40.194 --> 30:41.869
<v Andy>Oh well, that can happen.

30:42.568 --> 30:44.634
<v Andy>Happy birthday!

30:44.664 --> 30:49.140
<v Sheila>Oh, gosh look at that! Blimey,
how lovely. Thank you.

30:49.170 --> 30:51.413
<v Judith>- Blow out your candle.</v>
<v Andy>- Birthday breakfast for mum.</v>

30:51.443 --> 30:53.135
<v Judith>Make a wish.

30:56.474 --> 31:00.972
<v Sheila>Oh thank you, darling. That’s lovely,
thank you. Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.287
<v Andy>What could it be?

31:03.317 --> 31:04.885
<v Andy>Three guesses.

31:07.239 --> 31:09.898
<v Sheila>- Oh wow, that’s fantastic.</v>
<v Andy>- Is that the one you wanted?</v>

31:09.928 --> 31:11.663
<v Sheila>- Oh, Andy, it’s perfect.</v>
<v Andy>- Good.</v>

31:11.693 --> 31:13.965
<v Sheila>- I can’t believe you were listening.</v>
<v Andy>- Yeah.</v>

31:13.995 --> 31:15.100
<v Sheila>Oh that’s just great.

31:15.130 --> 31:16.873
<v Sheila>- That is just great.</v>
<v Andy>- Well I want it to be…</v>

31:16.903 --> 31:18.754
<v Andy>perfect for the barbecue.

31:19.041 --> 31:21.018
<v Sheila>Oh, and it’s not even old Eden
garden stock either, is it?

31:21.048 --> 31:22.491
<v Andy>It certainly is not.

31:23.241 --> 31:25.054
<v Sheila>What’s the matter with you two,
did somebody die?

31:25.084 --> 31:28.747
<v Andy>Oh they’re just miffed because I
dragged them out of bed this morning…

31:28.777 --> 31:32.404
<v Andy>and made them help with the decorations.

31:33.768 --> 31:35.225
<v Sheila>Oh, that’ll be nanna.

31:37.873 --> 31:39.373
<v Sheila>Hello?

31:40.082 --> 31:41.309
<v Sheila>Oh, hi, Wayne.

31:41.339 --> 31:43.586
<v Sheila>No, sorry, it’s my birthday,
I thought you were…

31:43.616 --> 31:46.177
<v Sheila>Yeah? Alright…

31:46.207 --> 31:50.336
<v Sheila>Okay now, listen, it’s my birthday today, right?
So you can only give me good news.

31:51.291 --> 31:52.541
<v Sheila>Yeah?

31:53.023 --> 31:54.152
<v Sheila>Yeah?

31:54.182 --> 31:58.927
<v Sheila>Oh, that’s fantastic! Oh,
they’ve accepted the offer on the house!

31:59.118 --> 32:01.600
<v Sheila>That’s fantastic, yeah. Yeah…

32:02.091 --> 32:04.232
<v Sheila>Yeah, we’ll sort it all out, brilliant.

32:04.262 --> 32:08.732
<v Sheila>Erh, listen, Wayne, there’s been
a little bit of a delay our end.

32:09.904 --> 32:11.497
<v Sheila>Well, is there anything we
can do to sort of you know…

32:11.527 --> 32:14.336
<v Sheila>just sort of seal the deal
and make it rock solid?

32:16.232 --> 32:17.232
<v Sheila>Right.

32:18.536 --> 32:19.736
<v Sheila>A what, sorry?

32:20.411 --> 32:21.965
<v Sheila>Alright, hang on.

32:22.252 --> 32:24.540
<v Sheila>You ever heard of anything
called a “lock-in agreement”?

32:24.570 --> 32:27.406
<v Andy>- No.</v>
<v Sheila>- I haven’t either. What’s that?</v>

32:27.952 --> 32:29.179
<v Sheila>Yeah.

32:29.602 --> 32:31.102
<v Sheila>Okay, hang on.

32:31.361 --> 32:33.216
<v Sheila>It’s like we put down
a big deposit but…

32:33.246 --> 32:36.016
<v Sheila>- it really seals the deal.</v>
<v Andy>- How big?</v>

32:37.216 --> 32:38.770
<v Sheila>How much would that be?

32:40.570 --> 32:42.738
<v Sheila>No, sorry, I don’t do percentages.

32:44.566 --> 32:47.061
<v Sheila>Right, okay, hang on.

32:47.443 --> 32:48.602
<v Sheila>21,000.

32:49.271 --> 32:50.880
<v Andy>- 21 grand, love.</v>
<v Sheila>- I know it’s a lot, but you know with…</v>

32:50.910 --> 32:53.307
<v Sheila>the pool and new job and…

32:53.648 --> 32:55.830
<v Andy>I know, but my first salary
cheque’s not in yet,

32:55.860 --> 32:57.384
<v Andy>and we haven’t had anyone
look at the house.

32:57.414 --> 32:59.771
<v Sheila>Oh, surely the bank
would give us a loan.

33:00.289 --> 33:01.839
<v Sheila>And it’s my birthday.

33:02.385 --> 33:05.825
<v Sheila>And you love me. And it’s my birthday.

33:09.449 --> 33:11.181
<v Andy>Ah, go on then.

33:11.767 --> 33:13.867
<v Sheila>Yes! Yeah, we’re gonna go for that.

33:13.897 --> 33:15.981
<v Sheila>Yeah, I know, fantastic!

33:16.500 --> 33:18.422
<v Sheila>Okay, brilliant, alright, yeah.

33:27.054 --> 33:29.772
<v Andy>I’m telling you, that petrol
gauge said half-full.

33:29.932 --> 33:32.114
<v Stu>Well, it didn’t say that
just now, did it, John?

33:32.144 --> 33:33.900
<v John>No, Stu, it said empty.

33:33.930 --> 33:36.204
<v Andy>Well alright, something’s wrong with
the gauge then, just get rid of it.

33:36.234 --> 33:37.800
<v Sheila>Finally.

33:38.345 --> 33:39.595
<v Sheila>Back in action!

33:41.036 --> 33:43.122
<v Stu>Sorry, this is wanted elsewhere.

33:43.152 --> 33:44.172
<v Sheila>What?

33:44.202 --> 33:46.404
<v Andy>Barry’s just got back from his holiday
and they’ve got a big job on.

33:46.434 --> 33:48.177
<v Andy>- Come inside, I’ll make you some breakfast.</v>
<v Sheila>- Listen, guys…</v>

33:48.207 --> 33:51.013
<v Sheila>We need to get it finished by Sunday.
Is there anybody you can recommend…

33:51.043 --> 33:52.541
<v Sheila>- to get it sorted?</v>
<v Andy>- Sheila!</v>

33:52.571 --> 33:56.236
<v Stu>Not even Superman would have that
done by Sunday, love. I’m sorry.

33:56.266 --> 33:58.868
<v Sheila>- Well how long is it gonna take?</v>
<v Andy>- It’ll be ready in time</v>

33:58.898 --> 34:00.927
<v Andy>for your precious barbecue.

34:00.957 --> 34:02.768
<v Sheila>You think the barbecue’s the point?

34:02.798 --> 34:07.295
<v Sheila>The barbecue’s not the point, Andy!
The point is the £21,000 we stand to lose!

34:07.325 --> 34:10.678
<v Sheila>The point is getting the house sold and
getting this place ready for buyers!

34:10.708 --> 34:13.937
<v Andy>Why can’t you just have a little bit
of faith?! I’ve said it’ll get done,

34:13.967 --> 34:16.269
<v Andy>now just keep out of my hair!

34:16.803 --> 34:21.248
<v Sheila>Fine. Fine. I’m gonna go make a call,
I’m gonna get this sorted out.

34:21.278 --> 34:23.343
<v Andy>No, you are not!

34:25.708 --> 34:26.758
<v Andy>Understood?

34:28.623 --> 34:31.991
<v Sheila>Okay, dig. Go on, dig!

34:32.021 --> 34:34.214
<v Sheila>Dig to fucking China!

34:35.134 --> 34:39.634
<v Andy>Right, that’s it, everybody out. Angel, come
on, you must have books to read or something.

34:39.664 --> 34:42.491
<v Andy>And you guys, can you clear,
please, quickly.

34:42.521 --> 34:45.982
<v Andy>I’ve got, uh… I’ve got some
digging to do, thank you very much.

34:46.855 --> 34:48.723
<v Andy>- Sorry, Stu.</v>
<v Stu>- Lay off!</v>

34:48.753 --> 34:51.287
<v Andy>- Please, Stu.</v>
<v Stu>- Lay off!</v>

34:58.358 --> 35:00.292
<v Andy>Got some digging to do.

35:00.322 --> 35:01.822
<v Andy>Everything’s fine.

35:02.378 --> 35:04.965
<v Andy>You still there, Angel?
I told you to go inside.

35:07.399 --> 35:09.199
<v Judith>Dad, please, let me help.

35:09.568 --> 35:11.463
<v Andy>Go on inside, Angel.

35:11.493 --> 35:12.949
<v Andy>Do some reading or something.

35:12.979 --> 35:15.581
<v Judith>Look, it’ll be twice as fast
if there’s two of us digging.

35:15.611 --> 35:17.599
<v Andy>Please, just go inside.

35:19.427 --> 35:22.999
<v Judith>- It’ll help us sell the house quicker.</v>
<v Andy>- Oh, now she wants to move.</v>

35:24.172 --> 35:25.172
<v Judith>Dad?

35:25.226 --> 35:28.101
<v Andy>Look, Angel, please,
will you just go inside?

35:34.911 --> 35:36.803
<v Judith>Can’t you see how you’re acting?

35:45.331 --> 35:46.944
<v Judith>I want to help.

35:51.263 --> 35:53.063
<v Judith>I have to make you see.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.895
<v Judith>I have to show you how
much you’ve changed.

36:01.204 --> 36:02.690
<v Andy>I’ll be fine, officer, really.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.245
<v Sheila>I’ve been ringing and ringing.

36:04.275 --> 36:07.408
<v Andy>I know, I’ve been in the hospital.
They wouldn’t let me have my phone.

36:07.438 --> 36:09.004
<v Sheila>Is that blood?

36:09.034 --> 36:10.926
<v Officer>He’s fine, he’s been checked over.

36:10.956 --> 36:13.031
<v Andy>Shh, I don’t want to wake
the children, please.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.722
<v Officer>I’ll just give you the
number for victim support.

36:16.752 --> 36:19.463
<v Ray>Look, I’m not the victim here, it’s Ray.

36:19.493 --> 36:22.446
<v Officer>It’s just in case you need to talk to us.

36:22.476 --> 36:23.672
<v Officer>Okay, goodnight.

36:42.159 --> 36:45.854
<v Andy>It wasn’t until I got nearer to
him that I saw it was… Ray.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.870
<v Sheila>Oh, God.

36:49.191 --> 36:51.227
<v Andy>What they’d fucking done
to him, I mean his face,

36:51.257 --> 36:54.323
<v Andy>it was like they took a fucking
crowbar to him, you know?

36:54.870 --> 36:57.610
<v Andy>- He was just lying there.</v>
<v Sheila>- Poor thing.</v>

36:58.348 --> 37:00.759
<v Andy>Why did I suggest meeting
him in the pub tonight?

37:00.789 --> 37:02.711
<v Andy>- Any other night this wouldn’t have happened.</v>
<v Sheila>- Listen, it’s not your fault.</v>

37:02.741 --> 37:05.198
<v Andy>All for his fucking wallet.
I mean, it’s his wallet!

37:07.416 --> 37:10.293
<v Andy>You know, half his face,
half his face was…

37:11.987 --> 37:14.748
<v Sheila>- It could have been you, couldn’t it?</v>
<v Andy>- It should.</v>

37:15.001 --> 37:18.110
<v Andy>At the hospital they kept
saying he might never…

37:18.846 --> 37:20.878
<v Andy>- he might never talk again.</v>
<v Sheila>- Oh, Christ.</v>

37:20.908 --> 37:22.708
<v Andy>I mean it was hanging off.

37:23.619 --> 37:27.598
<v Sheila>Ray’s got nobody to look after him, has he?
He has no girlfriend at the moment.

37:27.655 --> 37:29.182
<v Andy>Well, we’ll have to pitch in, I suppose.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.987
<v Sheila>Oh, Andy, he’s a salesman.
What’s he gonna do if he can’t work?

37:33.017 --> 37:34.801
<v Sheila>He can’t talk, he can’t sell.

37:34.831 --> 37:37.951
<v Andy>We’ll get somebody to cover
his accounts while he’s…

37:38.632 --> 37:39.914
<v Sheila>Jesus.

37:40.446 --> 37:44.164
<v Sheila>Come here, let me get this jacket off,
I want to see what’s going on here.

37:45.751 --> 37:48.137
<v Sheila>God, you’re covered in it.

37:48.167 --> 37:49.692
<v Andy>Oh, no.

37:51.233 --> 37:55.801
<v Sheila>Come here. I want to take this off you. I
want to take this off and have a look at you.

37:56.000 --> 37:56.885
<v Sheila>Come here.

37:57.492 --> 37:59.087
<v Andy>Oh no, no.

38:02.175 --> 38:04.000
<v Sheila>You sure you’re alright?

38:04.335 --> 38:06.871
<v Andy>Is there any more? Is there any more?

38:07.198 --> 38:09.517
<v Sheila>No, no, I’ve got it.

38:09.783 --> 38:13.764
<v Sheila>Come here. Just sit down over here,
let me have a look at you.

38:17.459 --> 38:19.723
<v Judith>I don’t know what to think, dad.

38:21.455 --> 38:22.805
<v Judith>All that blood…

38:24.537 --> 38:26.137
<v Judith>Ray in hospital…

38:34.560 --> 38:37.055
<v Judith>I don’t know what’s going on anymore.

38:42.716 --> 38:45.621
<v Andy>Yeah, I know, but it’s not
what it said on the website.

38:45.651 --> 38:47.775
<v Andy>It’s not what it said on the website.

38:49.343 --> 38:51.811
<v Andy>I know, I know it’s an unsecured loan.

38:55.589 --> 38:58.521
<v Andy>But 19% over 2 weeks
seems a little bit…

38:58.916 --> 39:00.866
<v Andy>Yeah, I know…

39:05.135 --> 39:07.658
<v Andy>There’s absolutely no way you can–

39:08.803 --> 39:12.308
<v Andy>But on your website,
on your website it says you–

39:17.210 --> 39:18.210
<v Andy>Hello?

39:21.505 --> 39:22.505
<v Andy>Hello?

39:24.986 --> 39:26.499
<v Andy>I know you’re there.

39:27.658 --> 39:29.117
<v Andy>I can hear you.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.454
<v Andy>I am not in the mood…

39:34.299 --> 39:37.205
<v Andy>for playing stupid fucking games.

39:46.543 --> 39:48.348
<v Andy>I can see you whoever you are.

39:55.605 --> 39:56.714
<v Andy>I can see you.

39:58.892 --> 40:00.160
<v Andy>I can see you.

40:01.578 --> 40:03.187
<v Andy>And I’ve got you!

40:54.589 --> 40:58.312
<v Sheila>- You’ve got to be joking!</v>
<v Judith>- Oh shit.</v>

41:15.688 --> 41:18.580
<v Sheila>I think we’d better get the
professionals in tomorrow.

41:20.563 --> 41:21.903
<v Andy>Maybe if I’d had some help.

41:21.933 --> 41:25.303
<v Sheila>Oh yeah, that’s right, no sorry,
don’t worry, it’s not your fault.

41:25.470 --> 41:26.927
<v Sheila>Not your fault at all.

41:28.264 --> 41:29.504
<v Andy>Works, doesn’t it?

41:30.507 --> 41:31.703

45:25.502 --> 45:28.089
<v Judith>Just look at yourself in
the screen, just look!

45:31.328 --> 45:32.814
<v Judith>Look, I understand.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.801
<v Judith>We’ll sort it out, alright?

45:38.850 --> 45:40.829
<v Judith>You don’t have to pretend anymore.

45:46.838 --> 45:48.208
<v Andy>That’s a great idea.

45:49.340 --> 45:50.695
<v Andy>Come play Abracadabra.

45:50.725 --> 45:52.008
<v Andy>Come on, everybody!

45:52.405 --> 45:54.028
<v Andy>Do you all know what you are doing?

45:54.058 --> 45:56.524
<v Everybody>- Yes!</v>
<v Andy>- Yes. Okay, so…</v>

45:56.928 --> 45:58.982
<v Andy>- Everybody in frame?</v>
<v Judith>- Yep.</v>

45:59.012 --> 46:01.686
<v Andy>You’ll like this?
Not a lot, but you will like it.

46:01.954 --> 46:03.137
<v Andy>Okay, so…

46:05.170 --> 46:08.013
<v Andy>Now I shall send everybody to Timbuktu.

46:08.944 --> 46:09.945
<v Andy>Shazam!

46:14.035 --> 46:15.188
<v Andy>Just like that.

46:16.220 --> 46:19.015
<v Sheila>- Right, now what then?</v>
<v Andy>- Now we rewind and play it again.</v>

46:19.045 --> 46:22.198
<v Andy>So everybody inside and let’s
have a look at it on the telly!

46:22.880 --> 46:24.243
<v Judith>Look, dad, no, don’t.

46:24.878 --> 46:27.437
<v Andy>Come on, Angel, we can’t all watch
it on the screen, it’s too small.

46:27.467 --> 46:29.228
<v Judith>Dad, don’t rewind it, alright?

46:29.466 --> 46:31.527
<v Andy>You’re such a spoilsport,
come on, in you go.

46:31.557 --> 46:34.904
<v Judith>I’m not being a spoilsport, just not
with everyone in front of us, okay?

46:34.934 --> 46:35.934
<v Judith>Dad!

46:36.614 --> 46:37.664
<v Andy>Look, Angel.

46:38.814 --> 46:41.489
<v Andy>- Come on, give me the camera.</v>
<v Judith>- Look, dad, don’t play it back.</v>

46:41.519 --> 46:43.673
<v Andy>- What do you mean “don’t play it back”?</v>
<v Judith>- Dad, don’t!</v>

46:43.703 --> 46:45.982
<v Judith>- Not in front of everyone, alright?</v>
<v Andy>- Look, Angel.</v>

46:46.012 --> 46:48.253
<v Judith>Dad, I’m telling you, don’t,
don’t rewind the tape.

46:48.283 --> 46:51.001
<v Judith>- Not in front of mum.</v>
<v Andy>- Look! Don’t be so selfish!</v>

46:51.031 --> 46:53.799
<v Judith>I’m not being selfish, dad,
don’t rewind it, alright?

46:53.829 --> 46:56.146
<v Andy>We’ll get another chance to see
Charlie fall in the pool.

46:56.176 --> 46:58.743
<v Judith>Look, dad, please don’t rewind
it, I’m telling you, don’t.

46:58.773 --> 47:00.373
<v Andy>What has got into you?

47:00.877 --> 47:01.943
<v Judith>Dad! Get off!

47:02.790 --> 47:04.204
<v Andy>Right, where were we?

47:05.192 --> 47:06.519
<v Judith>Dad, it’s a seagull.

47:06.728 --> 47:09.489
<v Andy>No, not there, there!
Not that, that’s a sea–

47:31.977 --> 47:33.782
<v Andy>No-one else will listen to me.

47:37.902 --> 47:39.359
<v Andy>So now it’s your turn.

47:42.286 --> 47:43.960
<v Andy>You one-eyed little fucker.

47:53.072 --> 47:54.882
<v Andy>You made me lie to my family.

47:57.146 --> 47:58.473
<v Andy>You made my wife…

47:59.907 --> 48:01.016
<v Andy>give up on me.

48:03.434 --> 48:04.434
<v Andy>My son…

48:06.044 --> 48:07.044
<v Andy>hate me,

48:08.427 --> 48:10.058
<v Andy>and my daughter betray me.

48:14.742 --> 48:17.286
<v Andy>So have you got any more
tricks up your sleeve?

48:26.089 --> 48:27.503
<v Andy>What do we have here?

48:29.183 --> 48:31.786
<v Andy>Judas Judith, our resident…

48:32.947 --> 48:33.950
<v Andy>snoop.

48:36.358 --> 48:39.032
<v Andy>Come on, love, look at the
camera, no need to hide.

48:40.864 --> 48:43.582
<v Andy>What does it feel like
being under the microscope?

48:46.489 --> 48:48.598
<v Judith>I wasn’t gonna show it to anyone, dad.

48:50.293 --> 48:51.350
<v Judith>I did it for you.

48:51.613 --> 48:53.679
<v Judith>So you could see what you look like!

48:54.822 --> 48:58.627
<v Sheila>Come on, get your stuff together,
we’re going to go into town for breakfast.

48:59.911 --> 49:03.517
<v Andy>Look, I told you, I was just trying to
buy some time to put things right.

49:03.547 --> 49:07.137
<v Sheila>Yeah, well, let’s hope it was
worth £21,000 down the toilet.

49:08.095 --> 49:09.584
<v Andy>I could have sorted it.

49:11.426 --> 49:13.277
<v Andy>Look, I’ll phone the sellers today and
see if they’ll change their minds…

49:13.307 --> 49:14.405
<v Sheila>No, you won’t!

49:14.435 --> 49:16.901
<v Andy>- about the deposit.</v>
<v Sheila>- You won’t phone anybody.</v>

49:17.126 --> 49:19.348
<v Andy>- Oh, come on.</v>
<v Sheila>- No, you come on!</v>

49:20.083 --> 49:21.784
<v Sheila>You’ve already lost us one house!

49:21.814 --> 49:23.896
<v Sheila>There is no way I am having you having

49:23.926 --> 49:26.513
<v Sheila>anything to do with me
trying to save this one.

49:28.702 --> 49:29.899
<v Sheila>Come on, you two.

49:32.747 --> 49:33.747
<v Andy>Judith?

49:34.765 --> 49:35.765
<v Andy>Come here.

49:36.986 --> 49:38.468
<v Judith>- Why?</v>
<v Andy>- Come here.</v>

49:42.907 --> 49:44.799
<v Andy>I want you to answer a question:

49:48.024 --> 49:49.124
<v Andy>Why is it…

49:50.201 --> 49:51.788
<v Andy>that you hate me so much?

49:52.545 --> 49:54.698
<v Judith>- Dad, I don’t hate you.</v>
<v Andy>- No, come on.</v>

49:54.874 --> 49:57.548
<v Andy>What was it that I did
that has made you hate me?

49:58.386 --> 49:59.742
<v Judith>Dad, I love you.

50:02.165 --> 50:03.165
<v Andy>Angel…

50:04.538 --> 50:05.691
<v Andy>Just tell me…

50:07.170 --> 50:08.620
<v Andy>Why do you hate me?

50:11.735 --> 50:13.493
<v Andy>I’m not gonna be angry, just tell me.

50:13.523 --> 50:15.016
<v Judith>Look I understand, dad.

50:16.149 --> 50:17.399
<v Judith>Why you did it.

50:18.810 --> 50:20.461
<v Judith>I know that you did it…

50:22.026 --> 50:23.787
<v Judith>- ‘cause you love us.</v>
<v Sheila>- <i>Judith!</i></v>

50:24.211 --> 50:26.211
<v Judith>I know that, I understand now!

50:27.206 --> 50:29.103
<v Judith>That’s why I did what I did!

50:32.240 --> 50:34.173
<v Andy>- Oh, my Angel.</v>
<v Sheila>- <i>Judith.</i></v>

50:48.846 --> 50:50.651
<v Andy>And there, you see, you have it.

50:52.098 --> 50:54.413
<v Andy>All our sweat. All our…

50:55.552 --> 50:57.886
<v Andy>Blood. All our muck.

51:02.350 --> 51:04.189
<v Andy>Good and bad. Sweet and sour.

51:06.821 --> 51:08.809
<v Andy>It’s a big Kings soup.

51:13.857 --> 51:15.662
<v Andy>And it’s all so simple really.

51:18.634 --> 51:20.660
<v Andy>All you have to do is take it out…

51:22.196 --> 51:23.349
<v Andy>and look at it.

51:29.865 --> 51:30.865
<v Andy>And so…

51:31.552 --> 51:32.748
<v Andy>your fun’s over.

51:34.026 --> 51:35.613
<v Andy>My little filming friend.

51:36.947 --> 51:39.023
<v Andy>No more watching everything.

51:39.683 --> 51:40.844
<v Andy>No more…

51:41.904 --> 51:43.448
<v Andy>storing everything away.

51:44.857 --> 51:47.190
<v Andy>Because now you’re going
to put things right.

51:48.726 --> 51:49.726
<v Andy>You see…

51:50.601 --> 51:52.754
<v Andy>if Judith can understand, I mean if…

51:53.166 --> 51:55.135
<v Andy>Judith can forgive,

51:56.072 --> 51:57.094
<v Andy>Well then…

51:57.745 --> 51:59.750
<v Andy>why can’t the rest of us? Hmm?

52:01.986 --> 52:02.986
<v Andy>You see…

52:04.337 --> 52:06.403
<v Andy>it’s the whole picture that matters.

52:06.745 --> 52:08.642
<v Andy>No more secrets.

52:11.087 --> 52:12.087
<v Andy>And now…

52:13.427 --> 52:15.042
<v Andy>you’re working for us.

52:16.434 --> 52:18.587
<v Andy>And you are going to put our family…

52:19.232 --> 52:20.602
<v Andy>back together again.

52:21.849 --> 52:22.909
<v Andy>Aren’t you?

52:28.252 --> 52:30.200
<v Andy>Alright. Here’s something…

52:31.260 --> 52:32.500
<v Andy>that you think…

52:33.527 --> 52:34.955
<v Andy>I don’t know about.

52:36.859 --> 52:37.881
<v Andy>There we go!

52:39.633 --> 52:40.633
<v Andy>See?

52:41.285 --> 52:46.300
<v Andy>I am not the only one with secrets, am I? Hmm?

52:47.141 --> 52:50.667
<v Andy>Right, now, let’s see
what else we can find.

52:51.929 --> 52:53.169
<v Andy>What did we find?

52:54.381 --> 52:56.645
<v Andy>Well, the answer is, not a lot.

52:57.691 --> 53:00.684
<v Andy>Just a few mementos, but…

53:01.794 --> 53:03.987
<v Andy>here, in an old handbag…

53:04.253 --> 53:05.826
<v Andy>hidden in the lining…

53:07.354 --> 53:09.092
<v Andy>we found this:

53:10.701 --> 53:11.701
<v Andy>It’s Joe.

53:12.336 --> 53:14.532
<v Andy>Look, you can just see his little willy.

53:16.944 --> 53:18.749
<v Andy>But there isn’t one of Judith.

53:18.971 --> 53:21.502
<v Andy>That’s something we need to talk about.

53:23.069 --> 53:24.656
<v Andy>I mean, we’re a family…

53:25.254 --> 53:26.254
<v Andy>a unit.

53:27.194 --> 53:29.192
<v Andy>No room for favourites.

53:30.613 --> 53:33.835
<v Andy>And here, as they say,
is one that I searched earlier.

53:33.865 --> 53:37.787
<v Andy>The lair of the Musby.
A place where daylight never enters.

53:38.942 --> 53:39.942
<v Andy>And…

53:40.687 --> 53:43.839
<v Andy>this is something you didn’t
feel the need to hide away.

53:45.544 --> 53:46.740
<v Andy>And over here…

53:48.168 --> 53:49.264
<v Andy>we have…

53:50.324 --> 53:51.651
<v Andy>cunningly hidden…

53:52.964 --> 53:54.204
<v Andy>What have we got?

53:56.245 --> 53:57.245
<v Andy>Some pills!

53:58.120 --> 54:00.099
<v Andy>And I bet that they’re not aspirin!

54:01.175 --> 54:02.884
<v Andy>And down here…

54:03.691 --> 54:07.626
<v Andy>a phone. And it’s no wonder you wanted
a new one, this one’s so full of film…

54:08.825 --> 54:10.891
<v Andy>there can’t be any room for numbers.

54:11.478 --> 54:14.154
<v Andy>And there’s one very special film.

54:14.730 --> 54:16.238
<v Andy>Starring Joe himself.

54:17.233 --> 54:19.101
<v Joe>Helen fucking Sanderson! Yes!

54:20.572 --> 54:21.572
<v Helen>- Hmm?</v>
<v Joe>- Nothing.</v>

54:29.774 --> 54:31.274
<v Andy>And that’s our bedroom.

54:38.243 --> 54:39.483
<v Andy>We’ve searched…

54:40.125 --> 54:43.601
<v Andy>everywhere in here, except for one place.

54:43.738 --> 54:44.738
<v Andy>And…

54:45.296 --> 54:47.243
<v Andy>where there are padlocks…

54:47.798 --> 54:50.185
<v Andy>there are usually secrets.

54:51.087 --> 54:52.087
<v Andy>So…

54:52.803 --> 54:54.086
<v Andy>let’s just find…

54:55.300 --> 54:56.540
<v Andy>what we’ve got…

54:57.853 --> 54:58.853
<v Andy>in here.

55:02.065 --> 55:03.522
<v Andy>My magic screwdriver.

55:23.021 --> 55:24.261
<v Andy>Honestly, Angel…

55:24.831 --> 55:28.071
<v Andy>if Joe hadn’t have been messing
about I wouldn’t have broken it.

56:58.385 --> 56:59.385
<v Male officer>Hello?

57:01.176 --> 57:02.176
<v Female officer>Mr. King?

57:22.667 --> 57:23.667
<v Andy>Okay.

57:26.200 --> 57:27.361
<v Andy>My turn.

57:35.866 --> 57:37.482
<v Andy>It was me that did Ray.

58:29.234 --> 58:30.236
<v Sheila>Kids!

58:30.755 --> 58:32.688
<v Sheila>Get up! Joe! Wake up!

58:33.337 --> 58:34.337
<v Sheila>Judith!

58:36.228 --> 58:39.430
<v Judith>- What’s happened to the lights?</v>
<v Sheila>- I don’t know, darling. Andy!?</v>

58:40.511 --> 58:41.759
<v Judith>- Where’s dad?</v>
<v Joe>- I can’t smell any smoke.</v>

58:41.789 --> 58:43.029
<v Sheila>No, neither can I.</v>

58:43.144 --> 58:46.297
<v Judith>- Where’s dad?</v>
<v Sheila>- I don’t know, I think he’s still out. Andy!?</v>

58:46.786 --> 58:49.259
<v Sheila>Look, you two wait here, I’ll
go down and check downstairs.

58:49.433 --> 58:51.486
<v Sheila>Joe, see if you can turn
that bloody thing off!

58:51.516 --> 58:52.814
<v Sheila>Just stay there, okay?

59:05.192 --> 59:07.692
<v Sheila>It’s alright, I don’t
think there’s any fire.

59:16.986 --> 59:17.986
<v Sheila>Bollocks!

59:25.910 --> 59:28.106
<v Sheila>Oh bloody hell, who’s moved the candles?

59:29.827 --> 59:31.110
<v Andy>You called for me?

59:31.248 --> 59:32.964
<v Andy>It was me you called for.

59:33.505 --> 59:35.337
<v Sheila>What the fuck’s going on, Andy?

59:36.411 --> 59:38.520
<v Andy>It was me you called for in a crisis.

59:39.641 --> 59:41.287
<v Sheila>What are you talking about?

59:41.317 --> 59:42.467
<v Andy>Oh my love…

59:42.803 --> 59:44.159
<v Andy>you see that fear you’re feeling,

59:44.189 --> 59:48.356
<v Andy>that fear in the dark, I can feel it,
every heartbeat of it.

59:49.200 --> 59:51.440
<v Sheila>You haven’t got a clue what I’m feeling.

59:51.508 --> 59:52.708
<v Andy>Oh, but I have.

59:53.345 --> 59:54.454
<v Andy>I really have.

59:55.408 --> 59:57.001
<v Sheila>If this is another one of your stunts,

59:57.031 --> 59:59.618
<v Sheila>- I swear to God…</v>
<v Andy>- You see, it’s like I knew</v>

01:00:00.283 --> 01:00:01.895
<v Andy>that you would go for Joe first</v>

01:00:01.925 --> 01:00:04.331
<v Andy>when the alarm went off, that
you’d go to save him first.

01:00:04.361 --> 01:00:05.549
<v Sheila>You shit.

01:00:06.007 --> 01:00:07.824
<v Sheila>- You’ve set this up, haven’t you?</v>
<v Andy>- Oh come on…</v>

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.850
<v Sheila>Put the fucking lights back on!

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.538
<v Andy>But we’ve got to face it, Sheila,

01:00:11.568 --> 01:00:14.378
<v Andy>we’ve got to face the way that
we feel about each other.

01:00:14.408 --> 01:00:18.338
<v Andy>It’s like with Judith. It’s not Judith’s
fault that you didn’t want to have her.

01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:21.695
<v Sheila>Don’t twist it, you know what a
state I was in after having Joe.

01:00:22.594 --> 01:00:24.164
<v Andy>Do you know what I realised?

01:00:24.194 --> 01:00:26.494
<v Andy>No, do you know what I realised
when that alarm went off?

01:00:26.524 --> 01:00:28.860
<v Andy>That I wouldn’t have known which room

01:00:29.171 --> 01:00:31.708
<v Andy>to run to first. I couldn’t
have picked between us.

01:00:31.738 --> 01:00:33.717
<v Andy>That fire would have taken us all.

01:00:35.113 --> 01:00:37.744
<v Sheila>You’ve got no idea how I
feel about my children.

01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:39.700
<v Andy>And that’s the point, exactly.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.945
<v Andy>You know, we’ve got to work
this stuff out, together.

01:00:43.205 --> 01:00:47.971
<v Andy>I mean, really understand the way that we
feel, the way that you understood me, Angel.

01:00:48.852 --> 01:00:49.883
<v Sheila>She’s here?

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:51.687
<v Sheila>Judith? How did you know?

01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:55.043
<v Judith>Dad, have you got the camera on?

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:56.599
<v Sheila>Are you filming this?

01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.462
<v Judith>He’s got night vision on.

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:03.716
<v Sheila>- You fucking freak!</v>
<v Andy>- No!</v>

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:06.356
<v Sheila>- You win, we’re off.</v>
<v Andy>- No, just listen.</v>

01:01:06.868 --> 01:01:08.871
<v Andy>- No, please. Please.</v>
<v Sheila>- You two, get your stuff.</v>

01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:11.274
<v Sheila>Just put something on,
as quick as you can.

01:01:43.587 --> 01:01:48.030
<v Andy>Right, look, nobody’s going anywhere. Just, no,
just go in the lounge and sit down, please.

01:01:48.837 --> 01:01:49.837
<v Andy>Please.

01:01:51.264 --> 01:01:52.764
<v Sheila>- Just get lost.</v>
<v Andy>- No.</v>

01:01:53.146 --> 01:01:55.519
<v Andy>No, look, I just want
you to listen to me.

01:01:56.608 --> 01:01:58.598
<v Sheila>Oh fuck! Where’s the keys, Andy?

01:01:58.628 --> 01:02:01.328
<v Andy>Look, just go and sit down, I’ll give
you the keys afterwards, I promise.

01:02:01.358 --> 01:02:02.973
<v Judith>- Please, dad.</v>
<v Andy>- Look, it’s alright, Angel…</v>

01:02:03.003 --> 01:02:05.612
<v Andy>I just want to show you some filming
that I’ve been doing that’s all.

01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:07.882
<v Sheila>- Yeah, well, tough shit!</v>
<v Judith>- Dad, come on!</v>

01:02:09.053 --> 01:02:11.260
<v Andy>Look, no, I’ve locked that door.

01:02:13.113 --> 01:02:15.831
<v Sheila>- Come here, kids.</v>
<v Andy>- Look, just go and sit down, <b>NOW!</b></v>

01:02:17.018 --> 01:02:18.018
<v Andy><b>NOW!</b>

01:02:28.976 --> 01:02:29.976
<v Andy>Right.

01:02:30.952 --> 01:02:32.061
<v Andy>That’s better.

01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:33.994
<v Andy>I won’t be a tick.

01:02:47.742 --> 01:02:49.899
<v Andy><i>Hi, you’ve reached the King family…</i>

01:02:50.108 --> 01:02:52.913
<v Andy>Right, let me show you what
I’ve been filming today.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.564
<v Joe>- Try anything like you did with Ray,
and this goes straight to the police.</v>
<v Sheila>- I don’t have any favourites.</v>

01:03:08.594 --> 01:03:11.847
<v Andy>- Look, Angel, y’know…</v>
<v Sheila>- You’ve just outed your daughter…</v>

01:03:11.877 --> 01:03:13.361
<v Sheila>- you creep!</v>
<v Andy>- No, Angel, look,</v>

01:03:13.391 --> 01:03:16.848
<v Andy>I-I just didn’t want you to have the
pressure, that’s what I’m saying.

01:03:17.091 --> 01:03:18.382
<v Judith>Can’t you see, dad?

01:03:18.894 --> 01:03:20.509
<v Judith>- It’s all wrong.</v>
<v Andy>- No.</v>

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.918
<v Andy>No look, this way I get to find out what’s
going on inside you, like any dad would.

01:03:25.948 --> 01:03:29.115
<i.action>[tearfully]</i> <v Judith>But, dad, <i>I</i> don’t
understand what’s going on inside me.</v>

01:03:29.145 --> 01:03:31.430
<v Andy>Right, okay, then we
can work it out together.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.507
<v Andy>But those feelings that
you have for Claire,

01:03:33.537 --> 01:03:35.909
<v Andy>there’s nothing to be
embarrassed or ashamed about, you know?

01:03:35.939 --> 01:03:39.068
<v Andy>You know, you can’t control love,
that’s the whole point!

01:03:39.317 --> 01:03:41.644
<v Judith>You don’t understand,
none of it’s right!

01:03:42.432 --> 01:03:43.600
<v Andy>Look, Angel!

01:03:45.857 --> 01:03:46.857
<v Andy>Look.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.365
<v Andy>- What’s that about?</v>
<v Sheila>- I don’t want to end up like Ray!</v>

01:03:50.395 --> 01:03:51.847
<v Andy>Oh, come on!

01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:54.751
<v Andy>I did that for us,
for the job, for the house.

01:03:55.114 --> 01:03:56.339
<v Andy>Oh, you cannot…

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:59.505
<v Andy>Alright, look, I’ll make it
up to him somehow, I’ll…

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:00.992
<v Joe>Fuckin’ unbelievable.

01:04:01.314 --> 01:04:04.293
<v Andy>- Look, stop filming.</v>
<v Joe>- Don’t tell me what to do anymore!</v>

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.102
<v Joe>Too slow, mental.

01:04:06.132 --> 01:04:08.324
<v Sheila>- Alright, Joe, you’re just making it worse.</v>
<v Joe>- There’s worse?</v>

01:04:08.354 --> 01:04:10.350
<v Sheila>Look, just go upstairs
and get Judith, okay?

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.439
<v Joe>- Oh, the little lesbian stalker?</v>
<v Sheila>- Grow up and do as you’re told!</v>

01:04:13.469 --> 01:04:15.625
<v Joe>Fine! Fucking “Madame Dildo”!

01:04:17.695 --> 01:04:18.795
<v Andy>It’s like…

01:04:18.935 --> 01:04:21.654
<v Andy>it’s not that difficult to grasp!

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:24.134
<v Andy>Look, I know it’s a bit
of a shock at first…

01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:26.464
<v Andy>seeing it all back like that, but…

01:04:26.816 --> 01:04:28.494
<v Andy>Think, this way we never need feel

01:04:28.524 --> 01:04:31.129
<v Andy>any shame, any embarrassment ever again.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:33.715
<v Andy>What I’m talking about
is better understanding.

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:37.137
<v Andy>All of us being happier than
we’ve ever been before.

01:04:37.167 --> 01:04:39.340
<v Sheila>- Hah! Happier?!</v>
<v Andy>- Yes! Happier!</v>

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:41.315
<v Sheila>Welcome to Andy’s world of happiness

01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:42.804
<v Sheila>- and understanding.</v>
<v Andy>- And why not?</v>

01:04:42.834 --> 01:04:45.334
<v Sheila>No, thank you. You promised me the keys.</v>

01:04:49.471 --> 01:04:51.680
<v Andy>A promise is a promise, eh, Sheila?

01:04:52.242 --> 01:04:53.242
<v Sheila>- Thank you.</v>
<v Andy>- I mean, Jesus…</v>

01:04:53.272 --> 01:04:55.707
<v Andy>you were the one that brought
up the truth, you know?

01:04:55.737 --> 01:04:59.977
<v Andy>Or does the truth only apply to—what
is it—mortgages and promotions, that it?

01:05:00.007 --> 01:05:01.307
<v Sheila>- “Truth”?</v>
<v Andy>- Yes.</v>

01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:02.667
<v Sheila>Truth?

01:05:03.461 --> 01:05:07.811
<v Sheila>You wouldn’t know the truth if it smacked
you in the mouth, you stupid arse!

01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:12.750
<v Sheila>Mr. Fucking Truth Detective? You didn’t
even check the date on the ultrasound!

01:05:13.644 --> 01:05:14.994
<v Andy>What do you mean?

01:05:15.606 --> 01:05:18.256
<v Sheila>I’d forgotten I even
had that, you bastard.

01:05:18.303 --> 01:05:20.120
<v Andy>- I don’t understand.</v>
<v Sheila>- No,</v>

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:22.649
<v Sheila>you don’t understand.
You never did understand…

01:05:22.679 --> 01:05:27.229
<v Sheila>what it meant for me having Judith so soon
after what having Joe took out of me.

01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:29.271
<v Sheila>God.

01:05:29.485 --> 01:05:31.650
<v Sheila>Andy, you… all that pressure…

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.651
<v Andy>- What pressure?</v>
<v Sheila>- Telling everybody I was pregnant</v>

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:37.193
<v Sheila>when I hadn’t even decided whether
or not I wanted to keep it!

01:05:37.223 --> 01:05:40.073
<v Andy>- I did that because I was happy…</v>
<v Sheila>- You liar!</v>

01:05:40.131 --> 01:05:42.281
<v Sheila>You did it so I couldn’t back out!

01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:45.136
<v Andy>- No, love, honestly…</v>
<v Sheila>- All I wanted was a fucking rest!</v>

01:05:45.166 --> 01:05:47.636
<v Andy>No, love, you’ve got
this completely wrong.

01:05:47.666 --> 01:05:52.016
<v Sheila>Well, I sure as shit wasn’t going to
tell you the third time I got pregnant.

01:05:52.274 --> 01:05:53.274
<v Sheila>Yeah.

01:05:53.401 --> 01:05:55.251
<v Sheila>There’s some truth for you.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:57.160
<v Sheila>Talk about that.

01:05:57.568 --> 01:05:58.668
<v Sheila>Digest that.

01:05:59.049 --> 01:06:00.449
<v Sheila>Fucking love that!

01:06:01.547 --> 01:06:03.347
<v Sheila>Come on, kids, we’re going!

01:06:09.402 --> 01:06:11.823
<v Andy>- Nobody’s going anywhere.</v>
<v Sheila>- <i>You keep away from me.</i></v>

01:06:11.853 --> 01:06:13.453
<v Andy><i>Just give me the keys.</i>

01:06:13.643 --> 01:06:15.310
<v Andy>- <i>Give me back the keys.</i></v>
<v Sheila>- <i>Get off!</i></v>

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:16.440
<v Joe><i>Get off her!</i>

01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:20.065
<v Joe>- <i>Don’t fucking touch her!</i></v>
<v Andy>- <i>Nobody is fucking touching</i></v>

01:06:20.095 --> 01:06:21.394
<v Andy><i>fucking anybody!</i>

01:06:24.653 --> 01:06:25.953
<v Joe>I’m warning you!

01:06:28.821 --> 01:06:29.871
<v Andy>How come…

01:06:30.383 --> 01:06:33.010
<v Andy>that I am the outlaw here? Hey?

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:36.347
<v Andy>I mean, I’ve lied about a
promotion for a couple of weeks.

01:06:36.377 --> 01:06:37.377
<v Andy>You…

01:06:37.604 --> 01:06:40.120
<v Andy>you have lied for years

01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:42.226
<v Andy>about killing our baby.

01:06:43.258 --> 01:06:44.958
<v Sheila>Andy, just let us leave.

01:06:46.139 --> 01:06:47.139
<v Andy>Look…

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.519
<v Andy>Oh, come on, don’t back away from me.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.220
<v Andy>Look, I…

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Andy>Will you stop backing away? Look…

01:06:53.404 --> 01:06:57.204
<v Andy>Look, there’s no point if you’re
all always backing away from me.

01:06:58.602 --> 01:07:01.252
<v Andy>Don’t… don’t…
now you’re being stupid.

01:07:02.208 --> 01:07:03.758
<v Andy>Open the bloody door!

01:07:05.332 --> 01:07:07.505
<v Andy>Alright, how come I’m
the baddie here then?

01:07:07.535 --> 01:07:09.086
<v Andy>How come I’m the baddie…

01:07:09.116 --> 01:07:12.224
<v Andy>when <i>you</i> killed our child?

01:07:12.727 --> 01:07:16.400
<v Sheila>Because you’re the bloody
bastard that I couldn’t turn to

01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:18.810
<v Sheila>when I had to make the
hardest decision of my life!

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.540
<v Andy>No! I’m not having that!

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:22.137
<v Andy>I’m not.

01:07:22.675 --> 01:07:24.725
<v Andy>I’m the bastard that loved you!

01:07:25.286 --> 01:07:29.609
<v Andy>I’m the bastard that was there for you!
You chose not to talk to me!

01:07:30.032 --> 01:07:31.932
<v Andy>And it wasn’t your decision!

01:07:32.127 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Andy>They’re not just your children!

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:38.087
<v Sheila>Andy, let us leave.

01:07:38.652 --> 01:07:39.652
<v Andy>No.

01:07:39.682 --> 01:07:42.534
<v Sheila>- We just want to leave.</v>
<v Andy>- Open the fucking door!</v>

01:07:44.296 --> 01:07:45.296
<v Sheila>Right.

01:07:46.004 --> 01:07:47.291
<v Sheila>No… Fuck!

01:07:48.772 --> 01:07:51.572
<v Andy>I just want to try and
understand, that’s all.

01:07:52.263 --> 01:07:54.063
<v Andy>I just want to understand.

01:07:55.291 --> 01:07:58.818
<v Andy>- Please, just talk to me.</v>
<v Sheila>- Andy, just let us go.</v>

01:07:58.848 --> 01:07:59.848
<v Andy>Look…

01:08:00.545 --> 01:08:02.243
<v Andy>I just want to understand.

01:08:02.273 --> 01:08:05.373
<v Andy>I don’t want to fucking hurt
you, you stupid bitch!

01:08:07.675 --> 01:08:08.775
<v Judith>Dad, please!

01:08:08.913 --> 01:08:10.148
<v Joe>- Judith!</v>
<v Sheila>- Judith!</v>

01:08:10.178 --> 01:08:11.578
<v Sheila>Get away from her!

01:08:13.307 --> 01:08:15.557
<v Andy>I wouldn’t hurt you, Angel, would I?

01:08:15.994 --> 01:08:18.394
<v Sheila>Keep away from her!

01:08:19.264 --> 01:08:20.264
<v Andy>Angel!

01:08:21.118 --> 01:08:23.348
<v Andy>Come on, Angel, you can’t
believe that I’d hurt you.

01:08:23.378 --> 01:08:25.468
<v Sheila>- Keep away from her.</v>
<v Joe>- I’m filming this.</v>

01:08:25.498 --> 01:08:27.730
<v Andy>- Angel!</v>
<v Sheila>- Just be careful, Judith.</v>

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.245
<v Joe>- Leave her!</v>
<v Judith>- Dad, no!</v>

01:08:29.275 --> 01:08:31.125
<v Andy>Stop being frightened of me!

01:08:32.231 --> 01:08:33.231
<v Sheila>Judith!

01:08:35.063 --> 01:08:36.999
<v Andy>- Look what you’re doing!</v>
<v Joe>- Judith!</v>

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.179
<v Sheila>- Shit!</v>
<v Judith>- Get away from me!</v>

01:08:39.209 --> 01:08:40.342
<v Andy>- No!</v>
<v Joe>- Judith!</v>

01:08:40.372 --> 01:08:42.480
<v Andy>- Angel!</v>
<v Sheila>- Oh, my God!</v>

01:08:43.599 --> 01:08:46.523
<v Sheila>- I’ve got you, I’ve got you.</v>
<v Andy>- You were swimming!</v>

01:08:46.553 --> 01:08:49.129
<v Sheila>- Joe, go get some towels.</v>
<v Andy>- You were swimming, Angel!</v>

01:08:49.159 --> 01:08:52.234
<v Sheila>It’s alright, I’ve got you,
I’ve got you. You stupid idiot!

01:08:52.264 --> 01:08:54.914
<v Andy>- I’m sorry!</v>
<v Sheila>- We’re not leaving. <i>You</i> are!</v>

01:08:55.478 --> 01:08:58.128
<v Sheila>Get your stuff and
you’re getting to Mike’s!

01:08:58.586 --> 01:08:59.586
<v Andy>Sorry!

01:09:00.007 --> 01:09:01.007
<v Andy>I’m sorry!

01:09:01.256 --> 01:09:04.756
<v Sheila>If you’re still here in the
morning, I’m calling the police!

01:09:06.245 --> 01:09:07.245
<v Andy>Sorry!

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.480
<v Andy>I’m sorry…

01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:12.348
