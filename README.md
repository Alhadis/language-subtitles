Subtitle language support for Atom
==================================

Syntax highlighting for various [subtitle/closed caption][1] formats.

Editor commands for manipulating timecodes, reindexing counters, and other tasks
specific to subtitle formats will be moved here in future. For now, this project
exists chiefly to supply [Linguist][2] with decent VTT and SRT grammars.

Supported formats
-----------------
* [x] [SubRip Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip)
* [x] [WebVTT](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/)
